# Spymaster-Codenames-Bot

This project is working to create a bot that would be able to play the role of Spymaster in the game Codenames. Given a set of clues and the corresponding teams they belong to, the bot should be able to provide the optimal clue for their teammate who is playing the role of field operative.
